# Red-Black-Tree

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree with operations that ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- Self-Balancing: Ensures a balanced tree structure through specific rotation and color-flipping methods.
- Insertion: Includes functionality for inserting new nodes while maintaining tree balance.

## Future Enhancements

- Deletion: Implementing node deletion with rebalancing.
- Additional Traversal Methods: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.
